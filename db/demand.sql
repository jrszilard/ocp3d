-- demand_signals — OCP3D's private demand ledger.
-- One row per signal of demand for a part: a full case-file request, a one-click vote,
-- or a membership claim (partless). This is the data that decides what gets digitized
-- next and when a group run clears breakeven.
--
-- Access model: the site's Vercel functions use the SERVICE role (server-side only).
-- anon/authenticated get NOTHING — RLS enabled, zero policies, and revoke the default
-- PUBLIC grants (Supabase grants through PUBLIC by default; revoking only `anon` is a
-- no-op — see the studio's supabase stack reference).

-- One membership per email. A membership is a PERSON, not a case: re-submitting the join form
-- used to write a second row and send a second welcome, and would have duplicated every future
-- bulletin. The member number is deterministic (sha256 of ["member", email]), so a repeat claim
-- resolves to the same LCS-XXXXX and the API can answer "you are already in the book".

-- Mailing-list state. The join form promises The Missing Knob, which is marketing mail: it needs
-- a one-click exit and a record of who took it. NULL = subscribed. Unsubscribing is deliberately
-- a stamp on the membership row rather than a delete, so a re-join cannot silently resurrect
-- someone who opted out and so the count of who left stays honest.
